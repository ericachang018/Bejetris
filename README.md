BEJETRIS (Bejeweled + Tetris)
===========================

Objective
----------------------------------------
Move your character to collect gems by moving the falling gems into rows or columns of 3 or more. Gather as many gems as possible. You can also collect hearts to gain extra lives as insurance against falling rocks. However, extra lives won't protect you if a column of gems reach the top and overflows.

Also, the game will speed up every 30 seconds. :)

Instructions
----------------------------------------
Push the gem by moving into it. Pull by holding down P while moving in the opposite direction.


You die when...
----------------------------------------
1) You don't have any extra lives left when a heavy rock falls on top of you. (You can touch it from the side or from above, but do NOT be below one.)

2) A column of gems overflow to the top.
